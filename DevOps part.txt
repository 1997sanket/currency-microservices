1. We can Zipkin and Rabbit on Docker.

2. We also need to add Zipkin and sleuth dependencies in the pom of all the services.

3. In order for our service to create a Docker image, we don't need a Docker file anymore, we can just put the configurations
	in the pom file.

4. The services talk to the Zipkin server through Rabbit.

5. If we had 100s of microservices, we cannot run them 1 by 1. So for that, we will need Docker Compose, which runs all the 
	services with just 1 command.

6. If you are using Kubernetes, then you DONT need client-side service discovery, api gateway and load balance, as Kubernetes handles it.

7. We also wont need zipkin and sleuth as k8s provides tracing. 

8. Only spring cloud thing we keep in microservices is the feign-client for REST calls
